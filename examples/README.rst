About
=====

This directory contains a number of examples of using the F5 Ansible modules to
perform various different tasks.

Some of these examples are contributed by F5 colleagues as well as customers. In
the event that that is the case, the example likely serves more as an example of
the modules in play than as a drop-in configuration.

YMMV in using any and all of these playbooks.

Support
=======

The playbooks in this, and other, directories is to serve as an *example* of
using Ansible to automation configuration of a BIG-IP or other F5 product.

As such, the maintainers of this repository, as well as F5, will be unable to
provide any support for the playbooks herein.
