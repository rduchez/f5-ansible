Support
#######

The code provided in this repository should be considered F5 contributed.
**Not** F5 supported. If you are familiar with similar verbiage on DevCentral, then
you are familiar with what it means here.

For code bugs or other issues, you should open a Github issue here.

There is also the option of joining our Slack team where you can ask questions
there.

There is a dedicated `#ansible` channel in the Slack team. It is recommended that
you ask questions there.

If you have a question, there are several F5'ers in the `#ansible` channel that
can assist you. "@here" is a way to ask everyone who is currently in the channel
a question. Otherwise, as "@tar".

For example

    @here I had a question about Foo and how it relates to Bar
